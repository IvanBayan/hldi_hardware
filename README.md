This is code for STM32f103 based PCB which implement home laser for home PCB manufacturing, it use ultra violet laser to make photoresis method done PCBs

Basically it's CNC machine which currently has 2 variants:
1. x axis stepper motor + y axis DC brushed motor with optical encoder line from PC printer
2. 2 axes are done with DC brushed motors kinematic is corexy 

Caution: This is currently in raw alpha & not fully working

GUI for this stuff can be found in sibling repository: https://github.com/pavel-ruban/hldi_gui
